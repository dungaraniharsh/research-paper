Enhancing Network Security through Optimized Classification Models


# Abstact
This study examines the efficacy of advanced classification models using the UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017 datasets to enhance Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS).
We employ a combination of Random Forest, KNN, DT, XG Boost Logistic Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models, optimized through various hyperparameter tuning to identify and classify network threats more accurately.
Results demonstrate that our integrated approach, particularly the Random Forest significantly outperforms conventional detection systems, achieving 90% and 100% accuracy for UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017 datasets in identifying diverse cyber threats.
These findings underscore the critical role of machine learning in advancing the reliability and effectiveness of cybersecurity measures against evolving digital threats.
